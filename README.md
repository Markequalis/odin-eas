# odin-eas

This was a project from The Odin Project's Full-Stack Development course during the Foundations portion. I had lots of fun working out the problems that I was having trying to figure out how to make all the coloring functions work.

Made some changes to the coding in the JavaScript due to the advice from Dom in the TOP discord. Thank you, Dom!
